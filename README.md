crosshub
========

Crosshub is a sophisticated stand-alone app to deal with heterogeneous pieces of data, transform them and store them in different target systems. Some would call it an Enterprise Service Bus.
But crosshub is more - it is flexible, easy to use, persistent and extentable.
Due to its highly flexible persistence layer and its java nature, it runs smoothly on your existing IT infrastructure.
There is nearly no need for configuration and you can get started - e.g. for development purposes - straight away.

Getting up running is easy as well - download the jar file and run the start script with specified parameters.
If you do not specify parameters, it will run on a H2 database and the web interface will be available at http://IP-ADDRESS:3002



# What crosshub can help you with
If you are...
  - facing several heterogeneous systems that all supply you with different data formats AND 
  - you need to pick the data up, bringt them to another layout OR store them in a different system

crosshub might be of interest for you.

Let me explain by giving you an example:

Assume, an insurance company is selling life insurances. To apply for an insurance, each applicant needs to answer questions concerning its health.

The applications will be received electronically and needs to pass several stations. The task of passing around, fetching data, transforming it and storing them in a third-party-system is one of crosshub's core features.
